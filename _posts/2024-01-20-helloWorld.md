# Introduction
Well, if you've stumbled upon this page, you're probably at least a little interested about what all this is. So lets start with "What IS projectAegis?" It's going to be a racing game within the same vein as the classic Gran Turismos, just heavily scaled down. It's going to be single player for the most part, I don't know if I will even get to the point of making a working multiplayer.

# Okay, so what's the plan?
I don't know. Right now, I'm still thinking about the specifics of everything and what this even is going to be. This blog is the documentation of my thoughts, in a sense. At least for now. I'll probably not start development until everything I want to do is planned, and that's going to take a WHILE. Especially because it's just me for now. Maybe I'll add more people in the future!

# What do I want to add?
At the minute, some of the key points of this project are:
- __Good single player experience with solid progression.__ I want it to be focused on GT3 and LMP car racing, while also having a shitbox-supercar progression feel. I don't know how I'm going to manage complexity here to be honest. 
- Decent car physics. Sim-cade feel is ideal.
- __PS2 era graphics__, I don't have the manpower and team to make anyting super detailed, but I think in this age where every racing game must be "ULTRA REALISTIC!!!!!" I think having a more stylized game with stripped back graphics would be cool, and could add a nice nostalgic vibe.
- __Tuning!__ I want people to be able to tune their cars to their liking, engine swaps come to mind as something I would want to add. 
- __CUSTOM LIVERIES!__ I want people to be able to use their own liveries for their cars in game. Do you wanna slap anime girls and ruin a 1 of 1 Le Mans Prototype? YOU CAN DO THAT! You want to be able to make your Porsche 918 hot pink? YOU CAN DO THAT! ***ALSO BIG THING, I want users to be able to hsare and upload their own liveries into the game!***
- __Support for keyboard and mouse, controller, AND WHEEL!__ I have no clue how I'm gonna do this, but I know I want this.

This list could literally go on for ages, but those are the super general things that I think I want to add. This list will for sure grow and shrink, and I'll be sure to document it all here.

# Alright, but HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS?
No clue. BUT, over the next couple of weeks, I'm going to be working on diagrams, wireframes, and all that boring ideation stuff to shape this idea into something doable and tangible. I'll post it all here! 

# Conclusion
Okay, well, that was a brief, and very limited introduction into what projectAEGIS is, this idea was something that's been brewing in my head for a while, but my ass decided to take this seriously at 12 AM, so I guess this is somewhat spur of the moment.
